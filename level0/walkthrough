When first logging in the level0 account, there is a level0 binary.

Executing it Segfaults. Let's open it with gdb.

Running the program in gdb indicates that it segfaults when trying to use [atoi].
Perhaps it lacks an argument?
Let's exit and run the program with an argument.

./level0 test
>No !

It doesn't segfault anymore! Let's go back in gdb and dive deeper.

(gdb) > disas main

We find out that after [atoi], the return value in $eax is compared with 0x1a7.
0x1a7 is the hexadecimal form of 423.

Let's try running level0 with 423 as argument.

./level0 423
$>

It seems a new shell is opened.

$>cat /home/user/level1/.pass
$>1fe8a524fa4bec01ca4ea2a869af2a02260d4a7d5fe7e7c24d8617e6dca12d3a

We got the flag!
